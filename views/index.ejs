          <h2>What is Blogurr?</h2>
          <p>
            Blogurr is a server side rendering blog powered by Node.js. It offers
            extreme customization and flexibility in terms of making sure your
            blog remains and looks like your blog. Get into the nitty gritty and
            modify the JavaScript to truly make it yours.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <h3>How do I start blogging?</h3>
          <p>You can click on the links in the navigation bar to get started</p>
          <h3>How can I add this blog to my current website?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a server side rendered blog. Which means that you will have
            to either reverse-proxy the port on which the index.js runs to your
            desired path or subdomain or if you're brave enough, generate static
            files using the EJS.

              >You will have to add authentication yourself as this framework
              does not provided that. It is recommended to protect the routes
              /manage-posts & /create-new-posts</b

          <h3>How can I make the blog <q>really mine</q>?</h3>
          <p>
            All the blog utilities used to generate content are stored in
            utils/blogutils.js. There you can find a bunch of well commented
            functions which you can edit.
          </p>
          <h3>How can I style the blog?</h3>
          <p>
            All CSS is to be written inside styles.css to take effect. To start
            with a fresh slate, CTRL+A and DELETE the contents of styles.css. To
            add additional CSS files make sure to link them in the header.ejs
            partial in views/partials/header.ejs

          <ul>
            <li>
              A static blog generator. I want this to be a server side rendered
              blog.
            </li>
            <li>
              An alternative to Wordpress, Hugo or the likes. It is a fun
              project to tinker with for you and me but not meant to be
              production level (yet)
            </li>
            <li>
              An example in good coding practices. I'm learning and this is an
              outlet.
