## What is Blogurr?
/blaw · gur/

Blogurr is a lightweight, server side rendering blog powered by Node.js and EJS. It offers extreme customization and flexibility in terms of making sure your blog remains and looks like your blog. Get into the nitty gritty and modify the JavaScript to truly make it yours.

## Get started

1. `git clone`
2. Create a `.env` file in root and add the `PORT` variable with a value of your choice (I defaulted to `3300`)
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5.  *Ta-da!* Now read the home page to fully understand what Blogurr really is and isn't.
